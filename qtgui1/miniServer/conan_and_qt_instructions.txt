[CONAN PACKAGES AND QT(QtCreator) INTEGRATION]
To build a qt and conan libraries projects:

In a terminal:

- Create your desire conanfile.txt custom libs file in same folder main.cpp is

- Create a conan build directory inside the solution, not the debug folder.

- Enter the folder created and run:
	conan install .. -g qmake
This command will generate a conanbuildinfo.pri in the actual build folder.

In QtCreator:

- In .pro file in qt creator add:
CONFIG += conan_basic_setup
include(conan_build_folder/conanbuildinfo.pri)

- Then just include your headers in your files and enjoy.
